# news_category_predictor_ML_model
News Category Predictor is a Machine Learning–based NLP project that classifies news articles into multiple categories such as Business, Sports, Technology, Politics, etc.
The model performs text preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF, followed by multi-class classification to predict the appropriate news category.

The project was developed and tested in Google Colab and includes an interactive Gradio interface for real-time text input and category prediction. This project demonstrates an end-to-end NLP pipeline, from raw text data to model prediction.
